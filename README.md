# GJK2D.java

Simple 2D implementation of the Gilbert–Johnson–Keerthi (GJK) algorithm for collision detection in Java, based off the [Molly Rocket video][mollyrocket].  The implementation is built around the java.awt.Polygon for collision detection but this can be easily replaced by another polygon class.  Main.java contains an entry point and demo application for testing the collision detection.

## Requirements
* javax.vecmath.Vector2d
